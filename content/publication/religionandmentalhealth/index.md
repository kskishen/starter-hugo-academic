abstract: Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns affected various aspects of peopleâ€™s
  lives, including their mental health. Using data from an online survey, we investigate
  the role of religiosity in mediating the effect of Covid-19 on mental health. From
  February-March 2021, we conducted online surveys in the USA among 5178 individuals.
  These surveys elicited responses on (i) the incidence of Covid-19 infections among
  the respondents or their immediate social networks, (ii) religious beliefs and practices,
  and (iii) mental health. Employing the CES-D scale, which tests for depression in
  clinical settings, we find that while the incidence of a Covid-19 infection is associated
  with significantly worse mental health, this negative association is significantly
  smaller for religious people. We show that the mental health benefits of being religious
  emanate from the ability to participate in religious activities.
